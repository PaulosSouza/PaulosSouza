### Hi there 👋

My name is Paulo Henrique from Brazil (🇧🇷). Currently I'm QA at [AP Interactive](http://apinteractive.com.br/#/) but I'm learning about ReactJS, NodeJS and React Native and I'm on an English course to increase my reading and speaking.

In my free time I like to watch soccer (⚽️), and movies (🎞️) and series (📺) and to listen music (🎵) and to play songs with my guitar (🎸), It's my therapy.

Would you like to find me?
